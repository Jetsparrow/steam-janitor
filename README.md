# Steam Workshop Janitor
_A userscript that makes browsing through thousands of mods viable_

**N.B.: this is a very crude, hacked together alpha. It doesn't even have a way to undo the filtering yet.**

## Filter mods

Adds a little "filter mod" X button to any workshop browse page. Use it, and you will no longer see the hundreds of miscellaneous translations to laguages you don't know, obsolete mods, etc. 

## Endless scrolling

After the filter runs its course, you will be left with barely any mods. Wndless scrolling fixes that.
