# Steam Janitor
_A userscript that makes browsing through thousands of mods viable_

## [Install 0.0.2](https://github.com/Jetsparrow/steam-janitor/raw/main/steam-janitor.user.js)
_Requires a userscript extension for your browser, like [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)_

**N.B.: this is a very crude alpha. Developed and tested in Google Chrome**

## Filter mods

Adds a little "hide" button to any workshop browse page. Use it, and you will no longer see the hundreds of miscellaneous translations to laguages you don't know, obsolete mods, or gachimuchi memes.

The userscripts adds a "filter" checkbox to the top paging controls, allowing you to switch between the filtered and unfiltered view.

## Endless scrolling

After the filter runs its course, you will be left with barely any mods. Endless scrolling fixes that.
