## [Steam Janitor v0.0.3-alpha - install](https://github.com/Jetsparrow/steam-janitor/raw/main/steam-janitor.user.js)
_Requires a userscript extension for your browser, e.g. [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)_

**N.B.: this is an early alpha. Tested only in Tampermonkey on Google Chrome**

## Filter unwanted items

A "hide" button is added to every item on a workshop browse page.  
Clicking it will hide the item forever - until you turn off the filter and unhide it.
Translations to laguages you don't know, obsolete mods, gachimuchi memes, and mods that are just not quite your cup of tea - hide once and never see them again.

The "filter" checkbox at the top paging controls allows you to switch between the filtered and unfiltered view.

## Endless scrolling

After the filter runs its course, you will be left with barely any mods. Endless scrolling fixes that.
